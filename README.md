This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project 

## Getting Started

This project incorporates the essence of a Music School that is on a mission to strike a few chords by the means of their aspiring students.

1. This project successfully presents the availability, functionality and sustainability of the said Music school.

2. The tech stack requirement for this project was kept to minimal yet profound in itself, which is: 
        1. Next.js Framework is used instead of React.js. Next.js made the routing and overall developer experience smooth and enjoyable.
        2. Typescript is used instead of JavaScript. As I learned it a few days ago, I wanted to apply it as soon as onto making a project.

## Future Upcomings
I intent to deploy this project. It doesn't matter how big or small a project is but since I made, I got to show it or atleast present.

## I will be incorporating Typescript in my upcoming projects so that's also something to look forward to.
